# Docker Host Provisioning and ElasticSearch Monitoring Stack

This repository is a combination of a simple Ansible playbook to provision a single Centos7 host for a Docker CE host role and a simple docker-compose service stack for an Elasticsearch monitoring tool. More info is in the [monitoring readme](./monitoring-stack/README.md) and the [host provisioning readme](./host-provisioning/README.md).
